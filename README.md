# Movie Recommender System

This is a movie recommender system made using Genetic Algorithm. This is trained on the popular [`MovieLens 100k Dataset`](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/).

This implementation only makes use of the inbuilt features of the `Python` language and the libraries `numpy` and `matplotlib` to data the dataframes and plot graphs respectively. The actual implementation of the GA is done in code, without any supoort of any external library.
